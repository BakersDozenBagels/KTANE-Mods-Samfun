  description: "[h1]Deprecated[/h1]\r\nThis mod is deprecated and will no longer recieve
    updates. I recommend you remove this mod and install [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1366808675]this[/url]
    new mod which has the same functionality in it.\r\n\r\n[h1]About[/h1]\r\nThis
    mod changes how cases are picked by the game, making it so that the game will
    always pick from the smallest cases that fit all the modules on the bomb.\r\nIt
    also fixes an issue from the vanilla game where a case would be picked that doesn't
    fit all the modules.\r\nIt will also try to pick a case that fits all the modules
    on the front face of the bomb, if a mission requests that."
